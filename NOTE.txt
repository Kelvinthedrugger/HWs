 
 our original approach doesn't work, since nbdev is optimized for 
 , building a library/project, instead of merely a function 
  to convert scripts, namely, calling "notebook2script()"
  will write scripts "from every cell that has #export in this folder"
  , not just in the current notebook, to whatever folder you've assigned
  => massive file from other notebooks will be re-written into current folder


 use different environment in nbs is fine, since one can always run it from shell
